# CALCULATION GUIDELINES

## Mindset (Q31-50)
- Romantic score = average(Q31-35): Questions about "perfect person", "love conquers all", "magical connection"
- Resolute score = average(Q36-40): Questions about "divorce not an option", "commitment over feelings"
- If Romantic > Resolute + 0.5: "Romantic Mindset"
- If Resolute > Romantic + 0.5: "Resolute Mindset"  
- Otherwise: "Balanced Mindset"

## Dynamics Positions (Q151-200)
Calculate 0-100 positions based on their answers:
- Solving problems: Q151-160 (reflective vs aggressive problem-solving)
- Influencing: Q159-160, Q191-192 (facts vs feelings)
- Change: Q161-162 (accept vs resist change)
- Decisions: Q153-154 (spontaneous vs cautious)

Higher scores on "aggressive/feelings/resist/cautious" questions → higher position (toward right side)

## Resilience (Q55-57, Q63)
- Average Q55-57 (positive resilience), reverse Q63 (negative)
- Convert to 0-100 scale: (avg / 5) * 100
- High: 75+, Moderate: 50-74, Low: <50
