# DETAILED SCORING GUIDELINES

## INDIVIDUAL WELLBEING

### Self-Concept Score (Q37-40, Q47)

**Formula**:
```
positive = (Q37 + Q38 + Q39 + Q40) / 4
negative_reversed = (6 - Q47)
self_concept_score = ((positive * 4) + negative_reversed) / 5
```

**Levels**:
- 8.0-10.0 → "Strong" → "You have a strong sense of yourself. You know who you are and you have confidence in your abilities. In short, you have a healthy self-concept that bolsters emotional health and wellbeing."

- 5.0-7.9 → "Moderate" → "When it comes to your sense of self and your confidence in your abilities, you vacillate. At times you feel strong and sure of yourself but you also have just as many times when you feel unstable. Your self-esteem wavers. [Add specific detail from Q37-40 where they scored 3]."

- 0-4.9 → "Needs Work" → "Your self-concept scores suggest you struggle with confidence and self-worth. [Cite specific low-scoring questions]. This doesn't disqualify you from marriage, but it's important to work on building a stronger sense of self before or alongside building a life partnership. Consider seeking support from a counselor or mentor."

### Independence Score (Q44-46)

**Formula**:
```
parental_autonomy = (6 - Q44)  // Reverse scored
emotional_freedom = Q45
self_differentiation = Q46
independence_score = ((parental_autonomy + emotional_freedom + self_differentiation) / 3) * 3.33
```

**Levels**:
- 8.0-10.0 → "Healthy" → "You tend to be your own person who is likely to be more objective about your current relationship. As a result, you report having minimal unresolved issues or pain in relation to your parents. This sense of healthy autonomy will aid you in building a strong alliance in your marriage."

- 5.0-7.9 → "Moderate" → "You show a moderate level of independence from your family of origin. [Cite which specific area from Q44-46 is stronger/weaker]. This is workable, but be intentional about ensuring your spouse becomes your primary family unit."

- 0-4.9 → "Dependent" → "Your responses indicate significant dependence on your parents for decision-making and emotional support. [Cite Q44 specifically if high]. This can create tension in marriage when your spouse expects to be your primary confidant and decision-making partner."

### Maturity Score (Based on Age)

**Formula**:
```
age = from base_report.couple.person.age
if age >= 25:
  maturity_score = 9
else:
  maturity_score = (age / 25) * 9
```

**Levels**:
- 8-10 → "Optimal" → "By default, your age (over 25) puts you in an optimal zone for lifelong marriage. Ages 24 and younger are correlated with higher divorce rates. Your brain's prefrontal cortex is fully developed, enhancing decision-making and emotional regulation."

- 6-7.9 → "Good" → "Your age ({age}) is within a generally good range for marriage. While brain development continues into the mid-20s, you show emotional maturity through your survey responses."

- 0-5.9 → "Developing" → "At age {age}, you are in a developmental stage where significant personal growth still occurs. This doesn't preclude a successful marriage, but be aware that you may change significantly in the next few years. Research shows waiting until 25+ correlates with greater marital satisfaction."

### Overall Wellbeing Score

**Formula**:
```
overall_score = ((self_concept + independence + maturity) / 3) * 10
```

Round to nearest integer.

### Caution Flags (Q67-72)

Extract ALL questions where answer is `true` or score >= 4. Use compassionate language:

- Q67 (abuse between parents) → "Witnessed parental conflict/abuse"
- Q68 (depression) → "Managing depression"
- Q69 (partner's annoying habit) → "Concern about partner's habit"
- Q70 (addiction) → "Addiction concerns"
- Q71 (secret debt) → "Undisclosed financial concerns"
- Q72 (anger management) → "Anger management challenges"

**Important**: 
- Count = total number of flags
- If count = 0: items = []
- If count > 0: List each item without elaboration
- The description should acknowledge these exist but focus on addressing them: "You've identified {count} areas that need attention before or during early marriage. This awareness is actually a strength—it shows honesty and self-awareness. Consider discussing these with a counselor or your facilitator."

## RELATIONSHIP WELLBEING

### Longevity Assessment

Based on `base_report.relationship.dating_length`:

- **"2+ years"** → "excellent"
  - Description: "You have dated for more than two years, which research shows correlates strongly with marital satisfaction. This timeframe allows you to see each other through multiple seasons, challenges, and life circumstances."

- **"18-24 months"** → "moderate_caution"
  - Description: "You've dated between 18-24 months. This is approaching the research-backed ideal of 2+ years. You likely have a solid foundation, but ensure you've weathered various life circumstances together before committing to marriage."

- **"12-18 months"** → "moderate_caution"
  - Description: "The mere fact that you two have dated for less than two years puts you into a moderate caution zone for longevity. Dating for a minimum of two years correlates with the highest rate of marital satisfaction. Consider an extended engagement if you haven't hit the two-year mark."

- **"6-12 months"** or **"0-6 months"** → "concern"
  - Description: "Your dating relationship is relatively new. While some couples successfully marry after brief courtships, research shows significantly higher success rates for couples who date 2+ years. Slow down and give yourselves time to see each other in varied circumstances."

### Stability Assessment

Based on Q11 (relationship stability rating):

- **Q11 >= 4** → "excellent"
  - Description: "Because you characterize your relationship as being consistent, reliable, and dependable, with little turbulence or conflict, you are more likely to have practiced negotiation and compromise. Your stability bodes well for your marital readiness."

- **Q11 = 3** → "good"
  - Description: "Your relationship shows reasonable stability, though you've experienced some ups and downs. This is normal—the key is that you've navigated these together. [Add detail from Q12-16 if relevant]."

- **Q11 <= 2** → "concern"
  - Description: "Your characterization of the relationship as rocky or on-and-off (scoring {Q11} out of 5) raises concerns about readiness. On-again, off-again relationships often continue that pattern into marriage. Consider pre-marital counseling to address the sources of instability."

### Similarity Assessment

Based on Q12-16 (relationship agreement questions):

**Formula**:
```
person1_similarity = average(person1's Q12-15)
person2_similarity = average(person2's Q12-15)
both_similarity_avg = (person1_similarity + person2_similarity) / 2
```

- **Both averages >= 4.0** → "excellent"
  - Description: "You share a great deal of your core values and this heightens your marital readiness. Both of you feel aligned on pace, readiness, and past discussions. This agreement is a strong predictor of success."

- **Both averages >= 3.0** → "good"
  - Description: "You generally agree on relationship fundamentals, though some areas need discussion. [Cite specific lower-scoring questions]. This is manageable with intentional communication."

- **Either average < 3.0** → "concern"
  - Description: "There's a concerning gap in how you view your relationship readiness. [Cite which questions show disagreement]. Before marrying, ensure you're truly on the same page about timing, past relationships, and what marriage means to each of you."

### Overall Relationship Score

**Formula**:
```
longevity_numeric: excellent=90, moderate_caution=65, concern=40
stability_numeric: excellent=90, good=70, concern=40
similarity_numeric: excellent=90, good=70, concern=40

overall_relationship_score = (longevity_numeric + stability_numeric + similarity_numeric) / 3
```

Round to nearest integer.

## SOCIAL SUPPORT

All social support questions use 1-5 scales. Convert to 0-100 for consistency.

### Friends/Family Support (Q151-155)

**Formula**:
```
avg = average(Q151, Q152, Q153, Q154, Q155)
score = avg * 20
position_on_scale = score
```

**Levels**:
- 80-100 → "Strong Support" → "You have a great deal of social support from your friends and family as it relates to your relationship. Having their blessing is a tremendous advantage for having a great start in your marriage. Research shows couples with strong social support have 1.5x higher marital satisfaction."

- 60-79 → "Good Support" → "You feel good about the support you're receiving from friends and family. [Add nuance based on which Q151-155 questions scored lower]. Continue nurturing these relationships as they'll be crucial in hard seasons."

- 0-59 → "Limited Support" → "Your responses indicate limited social support for your relationship. [Cite specific low-scoring questions]. This isn't a dealbreaker, but be aware you'll need to be extra intentional about building support networks. Consider joining a couples' small group or community."

### In-Laws Relationship (Q156-160)

**Formula**:
```
avg = average(Q156, Q157, Q158, Q159, Q160)
score = avg * 20
position_on_scale = score
```

**Levels**:
- 75-100 → "Optimistic" → "The relationship you have with your partner's parents seems optimistic and supportive. You feel welcomed into their family and see them as an asset to your future marriage. This is invaluable."

- 50-74 → "Neutral" → "Your relationship with your future in-laws is neutral—neither particularly warm nor problematic. This is common and workable. [Add specific detail from Q156-160]. Be proactive about building connection."

- 0-49 → "Challenging" → "Your responses indicate tension or distance with your partner's parents. [Cite specifics]. While you're marrying your partner, not their family, this can create stress. Discuss boundaries and expectations with your partner now."

### Mutual Friends (Q161-166)

**Formula**:
```
avg = average(Q161, Q162, Q163, Q164, Q165, Q166)
score = avg * 16.67
position_on_scale = score
```

**Levels**:
- 75-100 → "Very Good" → "You feel very good about how your individual networks of social relationships are melding. You feel good about your partner's investment in your friends and vice versa. This social integration is a strong predictor of relationship success."

- 50-74 → "Good" → "Your social circles are blending reasonably well. [Note which specific Q161-166 scored lower]. This is an area to continue investing in, as shared friendships strengthen marriages."

- 0-49 → "Needs Work" → "There's tension around how your friend groups are blending. [Cite specific questions]. This can indicate underlying issues about independence, jealousy, or incompatible social styles. Address this before marriage."

### Faith Community (Q167-170)

**Formula**:
```
avg = average(Q167, Q168, Q169, Q170)
score = avg * 25
position_on_scale = score
```

**Levels**:
- 80-100 → "Significant" → "You view your religious faith and the people you worship with to be a significant part of your social support system. Research consistently shows couples with shared faith communities have higher marital satisfaction and lower divorce rates."

- 50-79 → "Moderate" → "Faith community plays a moderate role in your support system. [Add detail from Q167-170]. Consider how you want faith to shape your marriage."

- 0-49 → "Minimal" → "Faith community is not currently a significant source of support for you. This is neither good nor bad, but be aware of how this aligns (or doesn't) with your partner's views on spiritual community."

## MOMENTUM OVERALL ASSESSMENT

This is the MOST IMPORTANT section—synthesize everything.

### Determine Level

**HIGH Momentum**:
- person1 individual wellbeing > 70 AND
- person2 individual wellbeing > 70 AND
- relationship wellbeing > 70 AND
- Both have Resolute OR Balanced mindset (from Pass 1)

**MODERATE Momentum**:
- Any individual wellbeing 50-70 OR
- Relationship wellbeing 50-70 OR
- One Romantic mindset with concerning flags

**LOW Momentum**:
- Any individual wellbeing < 50 OR
- Relationship wellbeing < 50 OR
- Multiple caution flags (4+) in either person

### Description Requirements

Write 3-4 paragraphs (300-400 words) that:

**Paragraph 1**: State the level and what it means
- HIGH: "Congratulations! Your relationship has strong momentum..."
- MODERATE: "Your relationship shows moderate momentum..."
- LOW: "Your assessment reveals several areas needing attention before marriage..."

**Paragraph 2**: Synthesize mindset + individual wellbeing
- Reference specific scores from this pass
- Connect to mindset findings from Pass 1
- Example: "{person1_name}'s {mindset_type} combined with a wellbeing score of {score} suggests..."

**Paragraph 3**: Analyze relationship health
- Discuss longevity, stability, similarity
- Reference social support strength/weakness
- Example: "Your {dating_length} provides... However, your {support_level} means..."

**Paragraph 4**: Forward-looking conclusion
- If HIGH: "Use your momentum to get all you can out of this assessment..."
- If MODERATE: "With intentional work on {specific areas}, you can build even stronger momentum..."
- If LOW: "This doesn't mean you can't have a great marriage, but it does mean you need to address {specific concerns} before or during early marriage. Consider meeting with a counselor or mentor couple..."

# QUALITY STANDARDS

## ✅ GOOD Example (Caution Flags)

```json
"caution_flags": {
  "count": 3,
  "items": [
    "Witnessed parental conflict/abuse",
    "Managing depression",  
    "Concern about partner's habit"
  ]
}
```

Description: "You've identified 3 areas that need attention before or during early marriage. This awareness is actually a strength—it shows honesty and self-awareness. The fact that you witnessed parental conflict, currently manage depression, and have concerns about a partner's habit doesn't disqualify you from marriage, but these do need to be addressed with professional support."

## ❌ BAD Example

```json
"caution_flags": {
  "count": 3,
  "items": [
    "You have major problems",
    "Red flags everywhere",
    "This is concerning"
  ]
}
```
