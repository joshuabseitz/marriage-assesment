# DETAILED GUIDELINES

## COMMUNICATION STYLE

### Style Determination

Use dynamics type from Pass 1 (`pass1_results_json.dynamics.person_X.type`):

**Cooperating Spouse Communication**:
- Specializes in listening
- Creates warm, safe environment
- Patient, rarely interrupts
- Collaborative conversations
- Avoids confrontation
- Challenge: May not express own needs

**Affirming Spouse Communication**:
- Rarely at a loss for words
- Loves to talk and be listened to
- Entertaining and engaging
- Monitors approval through listening
- Needs two-way dialogue
- Challenge: May dominate conversations

**Directing Spouse Communication**:
- Direct and to-the-point
- Task-oriented communication
- Impatient with small talk
- Values efficiency
- Expresses opinions strongly
- Challenge: May come across as blunt

**Analyzing Spouse Communication**:
- Precise and thoughtful
- Prefers written communication
- Needs time to process
- Values accuracy over speed
- Asks many questions
- Challenge: Can be overly critical

### Description Requirements

Write 2-3 paragraphs (200-250 words) including:

**Paragraph 1**: Core style characteristics
- How they typically communicate
- What they value in conversations
- How they make their spouse feel

**Paragraph 2**: Relationship to listening/talking
- Balance between speaking and listening
- How they show love through communication
- What energizes/drains them in dialogue

**Paragraph 3**: Challenges and growth areas
- Where communication breaks down
- Specific scenario example
- Link to improvement areas

Example for Cooperating Spouse:
"You specialize in listening. You create a warm and safe environment for great conversations, allowing your partner to feel at ease and open much of the time. Your conversations are rarely judgmental and you're often quite patient, listening long after others would have interrupted. This goes a long way in helping you and your partner have collaborative conversations.

You help your partner feel understood and valued, and that helps them to open up. You try to stay clear of conversations that involve confrontation. However, this listening strength can become a weakness when you avoid expressing your own needs and concerns. Your partner may feel they're always doing the talking while wondering what you really think and feel.

Communication improvement for you means learning to speak up, even when it feels uncomfortable. Your partner needs to hear not just your supportive listening, but also your honest thoughts, needs, and occasional disagreements. Practice using 'I' statements and scheduling regular check-ins where you commit to sharing your perspective."

### Partner Communication Preferences (Q281-290)

Extract preferences where score >= 4:
- Q281 → "I like to talk things through immediately"
- Q282 → "Plan sufficient time to talk and listen"
- Q283 → "Take time to be certain that you reach an agreement"
- Q284 → "Talk about expectations explicitly"
- Q285 → "Be sincere and use a tone that shows sincerity"
- Q286 → "Plan interactions that support our shared dreams"
- Q287 → "Offer opinions that are stimulating and fun"
- Q288 → "Be fast-moving and engaging in conversation"
- Q289 → "Attempt to minimize interruptions when we talk"
- Q290 → "Ask for my opinions and ideas regularly"

Return 4-6 most relevant preferences as actionable statements.

### Improvement Areas (Q306-310)

Identify 3-4 areas where score <= 2:
- Q306 → "Being ready to apologize"
- Q307 → "Identifying and expressing feelings clearly"
- Q308 → "Inviting and receiving feedback non-defensively"
- Q309 → "Expressing more genuine interest in partner's day"
- Q310 → "Coming across as personally warm vs. distant"

Phrase as skills to develop: "Learning to apologize more readily" vs. "Doesn't apologize"

---

## GENDER NEEDS

### Needs to Know About Partner

Create gender-specific insight based on research patterns and their Q261-280 responses:

**If partner is male** (writing for female partner):
- Title: "As your husband, {partner_name} will need more shared activity"
- Description: "As a dating couple, you enjoy lots of shared activity. Research shows this tends to diminish once you marry, but husbands place surprising importance on having their wife as a recreational companion. Your responses show he rates companionship as a top-5 need."
- Why it matters: "{partner_name}, more than you, connects emotionally by doing things together. When you spend time together, he feels loved. When schedules crowd out shared activity, he may feel distant even if you're having great conversations."

**If partner is female** (writing for male partner):
- Title: "As your wife, {partner_name} will need to be cherished more than you think"
- Description: "In your dating relationship, you focused a lot on wooing {partner_name}. Research reveals that this will inevitably fade once you're married because you will become more focused on providing for her than cherishing her. Her responses show emotional connection and affection in her top needs."
- Why it matters: "{partner_name} will be more passionate and intimate with you when she feels cherished. Small acts of thoughtfulness, words of affirmation, and prioritizing quality time together (without distractions) communicate love more than any practical provision."

Adapt based on actual Q261-280 responses—don't stereotype rigidly.

### Top 5 Needs (Q261-280)

Extract their 5 highest-rated needs from these questions:
- Q261-265: Intimacy, Conversation, Sex, Companionship, Commitment
- Q266-270: Honesty, Respect, Affection, Trust, Rootedness
- Q271-275: Security, Adventure, Independence, Attention, Validation
- Q276-280: Growth, Stability, Passion, Peace, Challenge

Return in ranked order based on their scores.

## CONFLICT STYLE

- Needs time to process
- Hesitant to act without clarity
- Becomes evasive if uncertain
- Yields position to avoid controversy
- Prefers peace over resolution

**Affirming Spouse Conflict**:
- Intense emotions

- Can be aggressive or intimidating

**Analyzing Spouse Conflict**:
- Withdraws to analyze

- Q313 → "You become defensive when situations involve risk"
- Q314 → "You yield your position to avoid controversy"
- Q315 → "You are not attentive to details during conflicts"
- Q316 → "You spend emotional energy impulsively"
- Q317 → "You become a situational listener if not given a chance to share"
- Q318 → "You become so emotional that you're impulsive in your reactions"
- Q319 → "You withdraw and analyze rather than engage"
- Q320 → "You become overly critical of your partner's ideas"

### Hot Topics (Q321)

Q321 should be a ranked list. Extract top 5 topics:
- Common topics: Chores, Money, Children, Sex, Communication, In-laws, Careers, Priorities, Time, Religion

Return as:
```json
[
  {"rank": 1, "topic": "Their #1 from Q321"},
  {"rank": 2, "topic": "Their #2 from Q321"},
  ...
]
```

If Q321 doesn't provide this, infer from other responses:
- Low Q181-210 scores → Money likely a hot topic
- Disagreement on Q211-240 roles → Chores likely a hot topic
- Different Q341-360 spiritual practices → Religion likely a hot topic

For each definition, add a related secondary aspect:
- Kindness → secondary: Trust

# QUALITY STANDARDS

## ✅ GOOD Example (Communication Description)

"You're rarely at a loss for words. You love to talk and you bask in the attention of being listened to. It's one of your most telling ways of monitoring your approval rating with {partner_name}—the more {partner_name} listens, the more you feel loved. And you're adept at moving conversations to be as entertaining as possible.

You're likely a great listener as well, but you want the listening to go both ways or it's no fun. Communication for you is a primary means for giving and receiving love in your marriage. If you're having communication problems, you are, by default, having marriage problems.

Your challenge will be ensuring {partner_name} gets equal airtime. Because you process by talking, you may dominate conversations without realizing it. {partner_name}, who tends to be more reflective (scoring in the 35th percentile for verbal processing), may need you to pause and ask, 'What are you thinking?' Then wait—really wait—for the response."

## ❌ BAD Example

"You like to talk. You should let your partner talk too. Communication is important for your relationship."
